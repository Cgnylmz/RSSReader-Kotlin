# RSSReader-Kotlin-Rx-MVP
## About
Small Android application to read RSS Feeds.

## Few words to start
This project is mainly for learning purposes. I just wanted to learn/improve in new technologies and since it doesn't contain any secret information I decided to share it publicly.
As the name of project says, it is written in Kotlin, Rx and uses MVP pattern. And the RSS reader is kind a simple app to start getting familiar with mentioned stuff. I'm sharing
this project also because I'm not an expert, so I will appreciate any recommendations or best practices from all of you. Thank you in advance.

I think it's not necessary to describe why Kotlin, Rx and MVP now. This project is not about WHY. It's about the code, willing to learn and always be better in development (moving forward)
and maybe it will help somebody to get started :)

(But don't worry. I will update the README continuously so once I will have some spare time I will describe all WHY-es, where I get inspiration - mostly from other GitHub projects - and more
about motivation to start this project.)
